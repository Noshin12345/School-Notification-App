Our app will help students and teachers better manage their time and tasks.</br>
Our first motivation is to provide a solution for this by helping students organise their class routine and study plans. By using our app, students can plan their study sessions more efficiently and make better use of their time. Teachers can also benefit from this feature by organising their class schedules and work time more effectively.</br>
Another common problem is students forgetting about upcoming exams and assignment deadlines. Our second motivation is to address this issue by sending alerts and notifications to remind them of important dates. By receiving alerts one, three, or seven days before an exam or deadline, students and teachers can start preparing early and avoid missing important deadlines.</br>
Furthermore, our app includes an attendance feature that allows both students and teachers to easily track attendance, helping to ensure that everyone stays on top of their commitments.
